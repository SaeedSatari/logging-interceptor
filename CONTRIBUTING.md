# How to contribute

We welcome any help... and good questions are actually _very_ helpful, too! Here's how to get going most efficiently:

## I'm not shure what it is

Just ask on [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/t1/logging-interceptor](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/t1/logging-interceptor?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## I have a question

Ask on [Stack-Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). We don't have a tag, yet, so to get awareness, post it on gitter, too.

## I've found a bug (in code or docs)

We try to fix bugs as quickly as possible, so you don't really have to check if the bug is already open, but you _should_ first make sure you use the latest version.  If you can reproduce it, open an [Issue](https://github.com/t1/logging-interceptor/issues).

## I have a suggestion

First look at the [apropriate Issues](https://github.com/t1/logging-interceptor/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=type%3Aissue+-label%3Abug+-label%3Aquestion)... this includes the _closed issues_. If it's already there, it may be enough to just add a thumbs-up. Or you can ask a specific question.

If your idea is new, create an issue... and maybe after some discussion you may want to create a pull request. Before we can accept any contributions, you'll need to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), but it's very simple, so it shouldn't be a problem.
